# About this repository

The files here are copied from Kingsborough Library's LibGuides Admin interface. They will not produce a workable site on their own, but you can glue them together in LibGuides; and with the relevant JS/CSS libraries added in, you can produce a working site along these lines: https://library.kbcc.cuny.edu

This respository is primarily maintained as a backup, but perhaps you may find something useful here.
